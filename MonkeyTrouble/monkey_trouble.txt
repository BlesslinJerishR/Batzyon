MonkeyTrouble

We have two monkeys, a and b, and the parameters a_smile and b_smile indicate if each is smiling.
We are in trouble if they are both smiling or if neither of them is smiling.
Return True if we are in trouble.


monkey_trouble(True, True) → True
monkey_trouble(False, False) → True
monkey_trouble(True, False) → False
